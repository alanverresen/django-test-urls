Welcome to django-test-urls's documentation!
============================================================================

.. warning::
    This package does not support class-based views yet, but support will
    be added in the future.


This small Python package defines a small set of functions that can be used
to test the mapping of URLs in a Django application:

* whether a URL is mapped correctly to a view
* whether a URL is not mapped to a view
* whether arguments are captured as expected
* detects mismatches between captured arguments and view's parameters
